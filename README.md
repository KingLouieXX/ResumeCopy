Lazy loading of experience collection
Add favicon
Loop through skills as an array instead of as a item in a collection
Unit test with Jasmine and Karma

IBM Cloud Hosting Info:

The Node.js app uses [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com) and [Cloudant noSQL DB service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db) to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI. To learn more about how the app connects to Cloudant, see the [Cloudant library for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudant).

The following steps are the general procedure to set up and deploy your app to IBM Cloud. See more detailed instructions in the [Getting started tutorial for Node.js](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/nodejs/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-node-js-on-bluemix).
